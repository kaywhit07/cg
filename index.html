<h1>Community Gardens: Gauging the Effects</h1>

<h2>Katie Whittaker</h2>

<div class=post>
	<p>In New York City, there are two kinds of public green space.  The first is city parks, including Central Park, where the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation is in charge of maintaining the grounds and providing opportunities for community engagement.  In Central Park, there are numerous volunteers and employees on golf carts, raking leaves in the fall and trimming tree branches when they become unruly.</p>

	<p>The second kind of green space is much more dependent on direct involvement from the surrounding homes and residents.  These are the community gardens.  Even though they are supported by the same department that works on public parks, there are some unique challenges facing community gardeners today.  Green Thumb NYC is an organization associated with the Parks department that encourages community garden growth and gives them a resource for support when gardens need materials or programming.  However, they don't have the same amount of protection as city parks, and if they are not supported by the local community, they may not survive.</p>

	<p>Some of these gardens are founded in lower income areas, which is a challenge in itself.  According to Lenny Librizzi, the assistant director of Open Space Greening at GrowNYC, "The residents of these areas have many social issues - child care, income assistance, homelessness, high instances of obesity and heart disease, high crime, drugs, so there are challenges not related to community gardens."  The mentality is that community gardens can serve to help a community by giving it a greater overall appearance, and giving young people a hobby.</p>

	<p>Another factor to consider is that young people are not always encouraged to participate in gardens traditionally run by older people in the community.  Howard Hemmings, vice president of Bissel Gardens in the Bronx, says, "community gardens are a place where people can help to put unity in the communities they're in.  However, as 'oldsters' transition, there is a void that youngsters don't necessarily identify with.  We need to nurture these relationships." Part of this can be attributed to a lack of programming, which Hemmings mentions as a problem with Bissel Gardens in particular.</p>

	<p>Ultimately, though, what is the effect of gardens on a neighborhood?  Can they be considered positive influences?  There is an incredible amount of data to look at to make conclusions, but I have focused on the number of gardens related to income, population, and crime in the borough.</p>

<p>When looking at the income of neighborhoods where community gardens are registered, it is clear that many of them, particularly in the Bronx, are in low-income areas.  The majority of the Bronx's 119 community gardens are in areas with a median income of $28,000 and lower.  In Brooklyn, where the median income is $46,085, about $12,000 higher than the Bronx, the majority of the gardens fall in neighborhoods where the income is less than the median.  Many of Manhattan's 144 gardens are in Northern Manhattan, including Harlem and Washington Heights, where the neighborhood incomes fall well below the $69,659 median income for the borough.</p>

<p>But what does the number of gardens mean related to the population of each borough?  Queens has .014 gardens per 1,000 people, while Brooklyn has .092, and Manhattan and the Bronx have fairly similar numbers, with .088 and .084, respectively.</p>

<p>Further, it is possible to look at the amount of crime per neighborhood, and while it corresponds most solidly to income, this is also related to community gardens.  Total arrests by population are greatest in the Bronx and in Manhattan, then Brooklyn and Queens.  However, this includes minor crimes as well as murder and rape.  To get a more comprehensive picture of the crime in areas immediately surrounding the gardens, I looked at this map outlining the crimes from January until December of 2014, looking at specific blocks where gardens are located.  I looked at Bissel Gardens, Family Garden in East Harlem, Manhattan, Newport Garden in Brooklyn, and Long Island City Community Garden in Queens.</p>

<p>The area immediately surrounding Bissel Gardens in the Bronx shows that there are a little over 2 crimes in that precinct per 1,000 people, and a little over 3 crimes in the borough.</p>

<p>The second, Family Garden in Harlem, also does not appear to impact crime in the area, with approximately 3 crimes per 1,000 residents in that precinct, and 3.8 crimes per 1,000 residents in the borough of Manhattan.</p>

<p>Newport Gardens in Brooklyn also seems to have little effect on crime in the immediate area, with 4.6 crimes per 1,000 residents in the precinct and a little over 3 crimes per 1,000 residents in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>And finally, the Long Island City Community Gardens in Queens has approximately 2.7 crimes per 1,000 residents in the precinct, and 2.3 crimes in the borough.</p>

<p>This is a random sampling from the list of gardens, but it illustrates that the location of a garden does not necessarily mean there is any effect on crime in the area.  This may suggest that community gardens are not currently doing the most they can to create change in a neighborhood, or even on a street.  Could this be improved through further programming?  Would additional funding be a solution to this problem?  While it is an important goal to promote change through green space, it may not be currently implemented the best way possible.</p>
